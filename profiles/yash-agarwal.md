# Profile: Yash Agarwal

I am currently a student at IIT Bombay, India pursuing Dual Degree(B.Tech + M.Tech) in Material Science and Engineering. 
Since my childhood, I have been very curious and interested in anything involving Computers or Technology in general. 
I guess it is this curiosity that made me pursue GSoC this Summer and contribute to the FOSS Community. I am also a member of a student robotics team ([Team AUV-IITB](http://www.auv-iitb.org/Web/)), which makes AUVs for competing in the RoboSub competition, where I'm a part of the Electronics Subdivision. 
Currently, I don't know where this going and what I'm going to do after I graduate, but I'm sure It will be something amazing and this GSoC will help me a great deal in it.
