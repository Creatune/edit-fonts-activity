Yash, Eli and I met on IRC today to discuss the mocks. 
Logs are available at <http://meeting.sugarlabs.org/sugar-meeting/2016-05-06>

I reviewed the [Sugar HIG](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Human_Interface_Guidelines) text, and Mark Simonson's Mock:

The HIG has some empty sections that need filling out, and also bringing up to date with the current Sugar Toolkit codebase. 

I made a updated Yash's [initial mock](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1ITy-XqcV3nkGV743eGUTfC1zkbzDui15thdrJYUe_Ag/edit):

into a [simple mock using the HIG terms](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Q9OzPnO9Oa8r7yHfzP2xKYTjNcQ04e2AG_ajPaHR_i4/edit):

and then a third [using screenshots of existing font editors](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1tk0B8dSKOxnznnu_BDOrm6Y0fyzqwdnmvtMJl4veUWg/edit):

Eli has been working on some more considered stuff so will share that soon - he took it to the local typography meetup here in New York City, [TypeThursday](https://medium.com/type-thursday) and everyone there was excited about the project!
