##New Features

* A few improvements to the Character Map class
* A Font Info Box added 
* A Multipage System
* Export/Import Buttons (they still require a little bit of work)

Here is a gif showing all the features

## Font Editor Area
_Its the box in the center of the screen where the user will be able to edit the glyphs or create new ones_

I'm making a draggable object on a Gtk drawing area for the making control points for the Bezier curves in a Font Outline

You can find an Intreactable Bezier curve [here](http://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/#introduction). This is a great guide on bezier curves from [Pomax](https://twitter.com/TheRealPomax). 

up till now I can move the object from one place to another on mouse click or on any other event.
Here is a gif showing this

My next task is to add the events for a mouse drag and then after the path after that is pretty straightforward, I plan to complete the basic editor this weekend :)
