The JS/HTML5 mock-up I'm working on is now [on GitHub here,](https://github.com/eliheuer/EditFontsMockUpJS.activity) screenshot of my GNOME/Fedora development workspace below:

I'll be updating this until our next meeting on Friday, trying out different layouts and doing some basic interactivity/animation.

To run the mock-up, clone Sugarizer like so:

`git clone https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer.git`

Then clone my mock-up into the Sugarizer activities folder:

`cd ~/path/to/sugarizer/activities/`

`git clone https://github.com/eliheuer/EditFontsMockUpJS.activity.git`

To run Sugarizer on your PC (GNU Linux/Mac OS/Windows), close any running instances of Chrome and re-launch it using the command line:

`chrome --allow-file-access-from-files index.html`

In the below screenshot(GNU Nano on the right) I have set a bash alias so I just type `xo` from anywhere in the terminal to launch sugarizer:
