In this past week I wasn't able to do much due to some external reasons

I've been working on building a mimimum viable product as explained by Dave in his post [here](https://sugarlabs.github.io/edit-fonts-activity/minimum-viable-product)

We can now create a new Font as shown below
(the current form design is very basic and will be further improved upon after the v1 release)
