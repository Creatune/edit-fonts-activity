This week I worked on the following aspects

* Character Map class improved slightly
* Multipage System improved
* Vertical Toolbars improved
* Repo cleaned up
* Code merged into Gonzalo's "Favorite Fonts" Activity on [master branch](https://github.com/sugarlabs/edit-fonts-activity/tree/master)

Here is a gif showing all the features:

Note that the icons in the vertical toolbars are temporary placeholders at the moment.

Also "Drag n Drop" of points is now working, enabling Bezier curves to be edited:

Currently the favorite makring bug is solved outside sugar (issue tracked here)
