title: Sugarizer on a Raspberry Pi

I spent some time today using Sugarizer on my Raspberry Pi 2â€”see photos below. 

One nice thing about Sugarizer is that you can easily set up a development environment on an ARM single board computer. That way you could debug, fix code and push to GitHub right from the Raspberry Pi. My understanding is that OSBuild and Sugar-runner aren't well maintained for ARM. They certainly aren't as easy to set up as Sugarizer. I'm leaning towards recommending this project switch to JS/HTML5, Raspberry Pi support is a huge plus for me.
