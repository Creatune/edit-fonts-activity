## Setting Up Travis
I couldn't get past a issue with the `./osbuild shell` timing out every time
I raised a Issue covering this [here](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/6152)  

## Font Import/Export Module
Inside the activity all fonts are stored as `defcon.Font` object and can be saves/exported in UFO, TTF, OTF formats
I have figured out the commands and the libaries regarding this but still have to write the modules in the main activty

### Importing Font
I have used [`extractor`](https://github.com/typesupply/extractor) module for this

#### Loading a ufo
This is done simply by using `defcon`
```
font = Font(pathToUFO)
```

#### Loading a ttf/otf
```
f=RFont()
extractFontFromOpenType(pathTTF, f)
```
The __problem__ here is that I dont how to convet `RFont` object to `defcon.Font()` object type

### Exporting Fonts
I have used [`ufo2ft`](https://github.com/googlei18n/ufo2ft) module for this (Trufont also uses the this module)

#### Exporting UFO format
```
extractFontFromOpenType(pathTTF, f)
f.save(pathUFO)
```

#### Exporting TTF/OTF format
```
from ufo2ft import compileTTF
from robofab.world import OpenFont
from defcon import Font

ufo = OpenFont('abc.ufo')
ttf = compileTTF(ufo)
ttf.save('MyFont-Regular.ttf')
```

## Font Summary Page
```
class SummaryPage(Gtk.Box):
    """
    This Class Creates the "Font:<familyName>" Page that loads up on clicking any Font
    """
    ...
```

## Font Editor Page 
```
class EditorPage(Gtk.Box):
    """
    This Class Creates the "Let's Edit Font:<familyName>" Page that loads up on clicking any Glyph in the Character Map or when the edit font button is clicked on the Font Summary page
    """
```

## Page Manager Class
* I've made a `PageManager` Class which is a subclass of the `Gtk.Notebook` Class that will manage all the pages or modes of the acivity
* I am trying to make a singleton class so that there is only one instance of the PageManager Object and I can switch to any page in the Notebook within any other class/file
