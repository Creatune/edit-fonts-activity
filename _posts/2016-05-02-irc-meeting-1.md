Yash, Eli and I met briefly on irc #sugar to discuss the project, and Yash agreed with me about developing a Python editor for Sugar Desktop. 
Eli and I discussed the merits of Sugarizer strategically (as the web platform is available on every computer) but it seems to still be in a beta stage of development, without many active daily users, while <https://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/statistics/> shows that Sugar Desktop has many thousands (if not tens of thousands) of active daily users.

Eli noted another GSOC project (for adding a git backend to the journal) held another IRC meeting this week, on #sugar-meeting which is publicly logged (<http://meeting.sugarlabs.org/sugar-meeting/2016-05-03>) so in future we'll meet there.
