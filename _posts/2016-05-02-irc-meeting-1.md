Yash, Eli and I met briefly on irc #sugar to discuss the project, and Yash agreed with me about developing a Python editor for Sugar Desktop. 
Eli and I discussed the merits of Sugarizer strategically (as the web platform is available on every computer) but it seems to still be in a beta stage of development, without many active daily users, while [activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/statistics](https://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/statistics) shows that Sugar Desktop has many thousands (if not tens of thousands) of active daily users.

We reviewed the [Sugar Labs Human Interface Guidelines](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Human_Interface_Guidelines) and started updating the proposal in [titanpad.com/sugar-font-editor-proposal](https://titanpad.com/sugar-font-editor-proposal) and will continue on that this week.

Eli noted another GSOC project (for adding a git backend to the journal) held another IRC meeting this week, on #sugar-meeting which is publicly logged ([meeting.sugarlabs.org/sugar-meeting/2016-05-03](http://meeting.sugarlabs.org/sugar-meeting/2016-05-03)) so in future we'll meet there.
