title: [sugar-devel] Python or JavaScript?
category: article

Over on the [sugar-devel] discussion list, a student who applied for the font editor GSOC slot, Mredul Sarda, started [a discussion](http://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/sugar-devel/2016-April/thread.html#52267) with a [post](http://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/sugar-devel/2016-April/052267.html) explaing his preference for JavaScript activities. 

[My reply](http://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/sugar-devel/2016-April/052308.html) explains why I suggest the font editor to be in Python, but expresses my reservations about the strategic value of this for the overall Sugar project.
