### Tasks Done

* Normalised the glyph drawing code
* Made a renderGlyph Class for drawing the glyph inside a specified box size
* Made a glyphGridInstance Class for drawing a grid of glyph from a given list
* Glyph aspect ratio problem solved
* A general Character Map class added

## Character Map Class
This class makes a character map of the specified font
the following are the ways to use it

# Multi Row Button Type Navigation

you can use it like this `CharacterMap = characterMap(font, 15, 10, 'BUTTON')` where `15` is the number of **Columns** and `10` is the number of **Rows**

# Single Row Button Type Navigation

you can use it like this `CharacterMap = characterMap(font, 15, 1, 'BUTTON')` by just putting number of Rows to `1`

# Multi Row Scroll Type Navigation

you can use it like this `CharacterMap = characterMap(font, 15, 10, 'SCROLL')` where `15` is the number of **Columns** and the number of **Rows** is ignored and all the available vertical space is given to the widget
