Eli and I met on IRC today to discuss the further tasks. 
Logs are available at [here](http://meeting.sugarlabs.org/sugar-meeting/2016-05-09)

We discussed about the following UI mocks that Eli made
+ [Mock 1](https://github.com/sugarlabs/edit-fonts-activity/blob/gh-pages/files/img/wireframe_concept_01_basic_icons.svg)
+ [Multiple modes](https://github.com/sugarlabs/edit-fonts-activity/blob/gh-pages/files/img/wireframe_concept_01_modes.svg)

We also discussed briefly about [gyph-mini](https://glyphsapp.com/glyphs-mini). It has a minified and uncluttered UI and some good ideas can be drawn from it. It is a paid app only available on Mac OS so here is a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9SqYnR-u7Y) showing it's basic features

We concluded that this weeks agenda should be 
+ Go through the dave's reading list
+ Making a detailed task list for Milestone 1
+ Making a mock UI in Gtk
