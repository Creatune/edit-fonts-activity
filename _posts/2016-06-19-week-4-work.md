I'm making a draggable object on a Gtk drawing area for the making control points for the Bezier curves in a Font Outline

You can find an Intreactable Bezier curve [here](http://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/#introduction) to get a better understand this. This is a great guide on bezier curves from [Pomax](https://twitter.com/TheRealPomax). 

Up till now I can move the object from one place to another on mouse click or on any other event.
